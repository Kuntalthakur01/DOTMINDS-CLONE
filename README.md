# DotMinds Clone 

This project is a clone of the DotMinds website, created
as part of my task in the  internship as a Front-End Engineer. The website is a
platform that offers various IT services and solutions. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my skills in
front-end web development by replicating the design and functionality of
the DotMinds website. This project is purely for educational purposes
and is not intended for commercial use. 


# Technologies 

This project is created with: 
* HTML5 
* CSS3 
* JavaScript
